# Task 7: Support Vector Machines (SVM)

This project is **ELEVATE LABS Internship – Task 7**
It demonstrates how to implement **linear and non-linear Support Vector Machines (SVMs)** on the Breast Cancer dataset (CSV).

# Files

- BreastCancer.csv → Raw dataset (uploaded CSV)
- SVM.py → Python script implementing SVM classification

# Requirements

Install dependencies:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn

# Steps Performed

- Load Breast Cancer dataset from CSV
- Split data into train/test
- Train SVM with Linear Kernel
- Train SVM with RBF Kernel
- Visualize decision boundaries using 2D projection
- Perform hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
- Evaluate model with accuracy score & cross-validation
