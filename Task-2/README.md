# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Titanic Dataset

This project is ELEVATE LABS Internship – Task 2
------------------------------------------------
It demonstrates Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for visualization.

# Files
Titanic-Dataset.csv -> Raw dataset
EDA.py -> Python script for analysis and visualizations

# Requirements
Install dependencies:
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly

# Steps Performed
* Load dataset (Titanic-Dataset.csv)
* Display dataset shape, info, head, missing values
* Compute summary statistics (mean, median, std)

* Univariate Analysis:
    - Histogram of Age and Fare
    - Boxplots (Age vs Class, Fare vs Survival)
    - Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis:
    - Correlation heatmap of numerical features
    - Pairplot of Age, Fare, Survival
* Categorical Analysis:
    - Survival Rate by Gender
    - Survival Rate by Passenger Class
* Interactive Plots (Plotly):
    - Histogram of Age distribution by survival status
    - Scatter plot of Age vs Fare with hover details
  
* Visualizations
    - Age & Fare Distributions (Histograms)
    - Age vs Passenger Class (Boxplot)
    - Fare vs Survival (Boxplot)
    - Correlation Matrix (Heatmap)
    - Pairplot (Age, Fare, Survival)
    - Survival Rates (Barplots by Gender & Class)
    - Interactive Plotly charts (Histogram, Scatter)
