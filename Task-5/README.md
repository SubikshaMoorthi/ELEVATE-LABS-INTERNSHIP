# Task 5: Decision Trees and Random Forests

This project is **ELEVATE LABS Internship â€“ Task 5**
It demonstrates how to implement **Decision Tree and Random Forest models** for classification on the UCI Heart Disease dataset.

# Files

- Heart.csv -> Raw dataset (UCI Heart Disease dataset)
- DecisionTree_RandomForest.py -> Python script implementing Decision Trees & Random Forests

# Requirements

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn graphviz

# Steps Performed

- Load Heart dataset from CSV
- Preprocess features & labels
- Train a Decision Tree Classifier and export the tree using Graphviz
- Analyze overfitting by controlling tree depth
- Train a Random Forest Classifier and compare performance
- Compute and visualize feature importances
- Perform cross-validation for robust evaluation#
